## API Sensor Types ##

These are json files we'll use as initial references for creating the sensortypedocs in the BO datastore. 

Once they're added to the API, the API will become the ground truth for the sensor type metadata for these types. 

You can access that data at: https://iot.aretas.ca/rest/sensortype/list

We'll start at type int 530 and go up from there
